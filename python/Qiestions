1. Please create a delete_person function that deletes any given person from the list and returns a new list without that person.
Expected result:
Result:

['juan', 'ana', 'michelle', 'stefany', 'lucy', 'barak']
['ana', 'michelle', 'daniella', 'stefany', 'lucy', 'barak']
['juan', 'ana', 'michelle', 'daniella', 'stefany', 'lucy', 'barak']

2. Write a function merge_list that merges two lists and 
returns a single new list merging all the values of both lists.

Declare an empty list.

Loop the two lists.

Append the results into an empty list.

Print the new variable with the merged lists.

ðŸ’¡ Hints:
You will have to loop through each list and insert their items into a new list.

There are more ways to merge lists in Python. This would be a good time for you to search on the Internet "how to merge lists in python".

Expected result:
['Lebron', 'Aaliyah', 'Diamond', 'Dominique', 'Aliyah', 'Jazmin', 'Darnell', 'Lucas', 
 'Jake', 'Scott', 'Amy', 'Molly', 'Hannah', 'Lucas']

3. At this time, the function format_greeting is printing the names only. Please update the mapping function so it creates a list where each item contains the following:
'Hello, my name is <name> and I am <age> years old'
ðŸ’¡ Hints:
You have to get the age of each person based on their birth_date.

Take your time to understand the already defined calculate_age function.

Search in Google "How to get the age of a given birth date in python".

Inside your format_greeting function you have to return a concatenation.

Expected result:
The result should be similar to this, but the ages might be different.

[ 'Hello, my name is Joe and I am 32 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Bob and I am 42 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Erika and I am 28 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Dylan and I am 18 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Steve and I am 14 years old' ]

4. Our customer needs a program that counts the letter repetitions in a given string, for example:

The string "Hello World" contains the following repetitions h=1 e=1 l=3 o=2 w=1 r=1 d=1.

Count the letters of the string in the variable par and print the number of times a letter is repeated throughout the string.

Capitalization should not affect the count (i.e. if there is a string that contains a capital A as well as a lowercase a the count for "a" should be 2).

Spaces should be ignored!

Expected result:
print(count("Hello World"))
# This will print: {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, 'w': 1, 'r': 1, 'd': 1}
